      <p>Welcome to our Webpage! On this website, we will show some of the games that we have been modifying so that people that are blind have an easier time to play them. We call this <strong> GameAssist</strong>. </p>

      <p> We think that these games will be easier to play for many different reasons. One reason why these games are easier to play is that we added a voice command that calls out to the player what's in front of them. For example, if you're playing Super Mario, then the computer will tell you that there is a Goomba near you.</p>

      <p> Another reason why we think these games will be easier to play is that some of the objects in-game have a colored box around them. This means that if there is a goomba approaching you, you can see it coming and realize that it is an enemy.</p>

      <p>We really hope that you enjoy these video games we modified!</p>

      <h2> About Us! </h2>
      <p> Our names are Ali J. and Rahul G. We both met at the 2019 Hackathon on November 16th. We decided to do this after we realized that we both <strong> LOVE </strong> video games and coding. </p>
      <p> We coded a program into Super Mario that alerted people that an enemy or obstacle was nearby by telling them through a voice. For example, if there was a goomba two blocks away from you, the game would announce "There is a goomba on the bottom right corner". </p>
      <p> We think that this project was really fun, and we hope you have as much fun playing it as we did making it! Hopefully in the future, we hope to change more games so that everyone can have fun playing them. </p>
